  "summary": "Python is a high-level, multi-paradigm programming language emphasizing code readability through significant indentation. Conceived by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected, supporting paradigms like object-oriented and functional programming. It is widely used in machine learning and introductory education, with only the 3.x series currently supported.",
