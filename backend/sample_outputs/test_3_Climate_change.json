  "summary": "Present-day climate change, encompassing global warming and its wider effects, is primarily driven by human activities like fossil fuel burning, which releases greenhouse gases, notably CO2. The article details the severe environmental and societal impacts, including extreme weather, sea level rise, and species extinction, while outlining global mitigation efforts and the complex scientific factors influencing temperature trends and climate feedbacks.",
