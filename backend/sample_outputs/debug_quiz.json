  "summary": "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, which strongly emphasizes code readability through the use of significant indentation. It is dynamically typed, supports multiple programming paradigms (including object-oriented and functional), and has become one of the world's most popular languages, particularly in the machine learning community. Major revisions include Python 3.0 in 2008, which was not completely backward-compatible with earlier 2.x versions.",

        "SETL",

    {
      "question": "Which core design feature does Python use to delimit blocks of code, distinguishing it from many other languages?",
      "options": [
        "Curly brackets ({})",
        "Semicolons (;)",
        "Keywords (e.g., END)",
        "Whitespace indentation"

      "answer": "Whitespace indentation",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule."

      "question": "Why was the 2008 release of Python 3.0 considered a major revision?",
      "options": [
        "It was the first version to support dynamic typing.",
        "It was not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions.",
        "It introduced the concept of the Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL).",

      "answer": "It was not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions.",

      "question": "In Python's memory management system, what combination of techniques is utilized?",

        "Manual memory allocation and static garbage collection",

      "question": "Which statement best describes the difference between Python's `==` operator and its `is` operator?",
      "options": [
        "`==` compares object references, while `is` compares object values.",
        "`==` is used for mathematical comparisons, while `is` is used for string comparisons.",
        "`==` compares two objects by value, while `is` compares object identities (comparison by reference).",

      "answer": "`==` compares two objects by value, while `is` compares object identities (comparison by reference).",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "In Python, == compares two objects by value. Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities (i.e., comparison by reference)."

    {
      "question": "Why can tuples be used as dictionary keys in Python, while lists cannot?",
      "options": [
        "Tuples support string concatenation, whereas lists do not.",
        "Tuples are immutable, a requirement for dictionary keys in Python.",
        "Tuples are written with optional parentheses, simplifying their syntax.",
        "Lists are designed for sequence unpacking, which conflicts with their use as keys."

      "answer": "Tuples are immutable, a requirement for dictionary keys in Python.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Lists are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (since dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples... are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries."

        "Performance beats purity.",
        "Errors should never pass silently.",
