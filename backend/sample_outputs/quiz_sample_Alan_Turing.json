  "summary": "Alan Turing was an influential English mathematician and computer scientist widely regarded as the father of theoretical computer science, primarily through his concept of the Turing machine. During World War II, he was a leading cryptanalyst at Bletchley Park, where he played a crucial role in breaking the German Enigma code, and later worked on early stored-program computer designs like the ACE. Despite his immense contributions, his life ended tragically following his 1952 prosecution for homosexual acts, though he later received an official apology and a royal pardon.",
