  "summary": "Machine learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence focused on developing statistical algorithms that learn from data to generalize and perform tasks without explicit programming. Historically rooted in early AI research and cognitive studies, ML is fundamentally built upon statistics and mathematical optimization. Modern ML approaches are categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, finding applications across numerous fields like medicine, computer vision, and",
