  "summary": "A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger composed of cryptographically linked blocks, conceptualized by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public ledger for Bitcoin and solve the double-spending problem. It relies on peer-to-peer networks and consensus algorithms to ensure transactions are resistant to retroactive alteration. Blockchains are categorized into public (permissionless) and private (permissioned) types, and their structure includes layers like networking, consensus, and dat",
