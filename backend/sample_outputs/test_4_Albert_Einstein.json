  "summary": "Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist best known for developing the theory of relativity and the mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc². He received the 1921 Nobel Prize for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. Einstein held German, Swiss, and American citizenships throughout his life, fleeing Germany in 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party.",
