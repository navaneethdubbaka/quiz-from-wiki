  "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks associated with human intelligence, such as learning and reasoning. Founded in 1956, the field experienced cycles of optimism and disappointment (AI winters) but saw massive acceleration after 2012 due to the use of GPUs for deep learning and the subsequent development of architectures like the transformer. Modern AI research focuses on goals like natural language processing, perception, and achieving artifi",
