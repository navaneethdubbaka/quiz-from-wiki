  "summary": "The Internet of Things (IoT) describes physical objects embedded with sensors and software that connect and exchange data over networks. While popular in consumer smart homes, its primary applications lie in commercial and industrial sectors, such as asset tracking, which accounts for 22% of the market. The growth of IoT necessitates addressing significant concerns regarding privacy and security.",
