  "summary": "Photosynthesis is the biological process used by autotrophic organisms like plants and cyanobacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy, stored primarily as carbohydrates. Oxygenic photosynthesis releases oxygen as a byproduct of water splitting, playing a critical role in maintaining the Earth's atmosphere. The process involves light-dependent reactions that produce ATP and NADPH, followed by light-independent reactions (the Calvin cycle) that fix carbon dioxide into sugars.",
